# Gaussian Spectral Decomposition of above-water reflectance

## Background
Spectral component analysis, also referred to as spectral decomposition or unmixing, separates a mixed spectrum into the sum of spectra corresponding to different optically active components. The spectral decomposition has been applied to retrieve Chlorophyll-a and Total Suspended Matter, Optical water classification, phytoplankton absorption, cyanobacteria absorption, turbidity, and overall water quality assessment in aquatic environments. Spectral decomposition methods are accomplished by identifying the optically active components (end-members) and their corresponding spectra, and by establishing the relationship between the decomposition coefficients and the respective components. The end-members reflectance spectra can be determined based on laboratory determination, in-situ observations, satellite-derived reflectance data, or simulated using bio-optical models. The linear regression method utilizes the linear mixing model, in which the end-members are characterized as representatives of various water types that are primarily influenced by one or more constituents. The Gaussian spectral decomposition models end-members using a Gaussian mixture model to account for variability due to water constituents.
